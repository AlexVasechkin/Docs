Here you can indicate synonyms for your visitors’ queries.

The system is easy: if there is a word in a query that is indicated here, its synonym is added to it.
There can be as many synonyms as you want. Not only can they be added to the original word, they can also replace it.

This can help you to correct common misspellings in products’ names and so on.

For example, if you have whiskas product, you can add following records to it:

* wiskas
* уискас
* вискас
* etc. – see your [queries][1]
